# SegBo: A Database of Borrowed Sounds in the World's Languages

The SegBo data files currently consist of:

- SegBo database - Metadata.csv -- spreadsheet dump of the metadata
- SegBo database - Phonemes.csv -- spreadsheet dump of the phonemes
- segbo_merged.csv -- merged metadata and phonemes files
- segbo_with_glottolog.csv -- merged metadata and phonemes files with additional Glottolog data

The current version is a preliminary beta release with 66 data points (doculects) that contain 177 observations of segment borrowing. The full version contains over 500 data points and 1600+ observations. We are curating the data for release in 2020.
