SegBo: A Database of Borrowed Sounds in the World’s Languages

SegBo is the first large-scale cross-linguistic database of borrowed phonological segments. It is a work in progress by:

- Eitan Grossman (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
- Elad Eisen (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
- Dmitry Nikolaev (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
- Steven Moran (University of Zurich)

Preliminary studies based on SegBo have been presented at the following conferences:

- How different were phonological distributions?: The World Survey of Phonological Segment Borrowing and the Uniformitarian Assumption.
*Societas Linguistica Europaea* 52 (Leipzig, August 2019).
- The typology of phonological segment borrowing. *Association for Linguistic Typology* 13 (Pavia, September 2019).
- What 'contact typologists' want from descriptive grammars. *Descriptive Grammars and Typology: The Challenges of Writing Grammars of Underdescribed and Endangered Languages* (Helsinki, March 2019).
- Rethinking the Uniformitarian Hypothesis. *Prague Linguistics* (Prague, 2019).

The following publications are based on SegBo.

- Grossman, Eitan, Elad Eisen, Dmitry Nikolaev and Steven Moran. 2019+. SegBo: A Database of Borrowed Sounds in the World’s Languages. Submitted to *Language Resources and Evaluation.
- Eisen, Elad. 2019. *The typology of phonological segment borrowing*. Hebrew University of Jerusalem MA thesis.  

Several articles based on SegBo are in the works, and we are working on setting up a website to make the data accessible, so stay tuned.
