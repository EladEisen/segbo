# SegBo: A Database of Borrowed Sounds in the World's Languages

SegBo is the first large-scale cross-linguistic database of borrowed phonological segments. It is a work in progress by:

- [Eitan Grossman](https://en.linguistics.huji.ac.il/people/eitan-grossman) (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
- [Elad Eisen](https://en.linguistics.huji.ac.il/people/elad-eisen) (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
- [Dmitry Nikolaev](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/dmni1849-1.465312) (Stockholm University)
- [Steven Moran](https://www.spur.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/Personen/staff/postdocs/Steven-Moran.html) (University of Zurich)

If you use the SegBo data in your research, please cite the specific version for replicability purposes. We archive each release of SegBo in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3633917).

Preliminary studies based on SegBo have been presented at the following conferences:

How different were phonological distributions?: The World Survey of Phonological Segment Borrowing and the Uniformitarian Assumption. *Societas Linguistica Europaea* 52 (Leipzig, August 2019).

We had planned on presenting our work at [EVOLANG 13 in Brussels](https://brussels.evolang.org), but given the current circumstances, the conference has been cancelled. Our short paper is nevertheless available online: [https://brussels.evolang.org/proceedings/papers/EvoLang13_paper_182.pdf](https://brussels.evolang.org/proceedings/papers/EvoLang13_paper_182.pdf).

The following work is based on SegBo:

- Grossman, Eitan, Elad Eisen, Dmitry Nikolaev and Steven Moran. Submitted. SegBo: A Database of Borrowed Sounds in the Worldâ€™s Languages. *Language Resources and Evaluation*. To appear May, 2020.

- Eisen, Elad. 2019. *The typology of phonological segment borrowing*. Hebrew University of Jerusalem MA thesis.  

Several articles using SegBo are in the works, and we are working on setting up a website to make the data accessible via a GUI, so stay tuned.
